字号大小就是字体的高度，例如设置字号为50px，那么它的高度如下图所示

>Different font-families, same font-size, give various heights
[[ lineHeight.md | 行距#lineHeight ]]

半行距 = (lineHeight – fontSize) / 2。

```HTML
<p>
    <span class="a">Ba</span>
    <span class="b">Ba</span>
    <span class="c">Ba</span>
</p>
```
```CSS
p  { font-size: 100px }
.a { font-family: Helvetica }
.b { font-family: Gruppo    }
.c { font-family: Catamaran }
```
Using the same font-size with different font-families produce elements with various heights:

Even if we’re aware of that behavior, why font-size: 100px does not create elements with 100px height? I’ve measured and found these values: Helvetica: 115px, Gruppo: 97px and Catamaran: 164px

Although it seems a bit weird at first, it’s totally expected. The reason **lays down inside the font itself**. Here is how it works:
- `@red:a font defines its em-square (or UPM, units per em)`, a kind of container where each character will be drawn. This square uses relative units and is generally set at 1000 units. But it can also be 1024, 2048 or anything else.
- `@red:based on its relative units, metrics of the fonts are set (ascender, descender, capital height, x-height, etc.)`. Note that some values can bleed outside of the em-square.
- in the browser, `@red:relative units are scaled to fit the desired font-size`.

Let’s take the Catamaran font and open it in FontForge to get metrics:
- the em-square is 1000
- the ascender is 1100 and the descender is 540. After running some tests, it seems that browsers use the HHead Ascent/Descent values on Mac OS, and Win Ascent/Descent values on Windows (these values may differ!). We also note that Capital Height is 680 and X height is 485.

That means the Catamaran font uses 1100 + 540 units in a 1000 units em-square, which gives a height of 164px when setting font-size: 100px. This computed height defines the content-area of an element
