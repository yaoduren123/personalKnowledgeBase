## 备注
-   **number value(unit-less value) best method for setting line-height** as line-heights will then always scale with the relevant font size
- it is safe to assume that **headings can have less relative line-height than paragraphs of text**. For example: heading 1.2 normal content 1.5
- WCAG 2.0: **line spacing is at least space and a half  within paragraphs**. This means that to be  AAA compliant, **paragraphs line-height should be set to 1.5**
